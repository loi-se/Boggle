HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
--------------------------------------
To start a game, simply click 'Shuffle'. You can set the field size, the langauge you play in, the timer in seconds and if the timer is active or not.
 
When you hit ' Shuffle" the game will create a board. As soon as the board is completely visible, your timer starts! 
Then it is time to type all your words into the lightgreen textbox in the upper left corner of the screen! Press "ENTER" to confirm the word.
 
When you are out of time the game is over! When this happens, your final scores are all presented to you so you know how you did.
You can also see which of the possible words you found (these words are shown in green in the gridview showing all possible words) and which not.
By pressing the button: "Solve" during a game session you stop the timer and see all possible words. 

When you click on a row header column of a word in the gridview with all possible words you can see where the word is located in the Boggle field.
At any time you can click "shuffle" to stop the current game and start a new one immediately. 


OBJECTIVE OF BOGGLE:
-------------------------------
The objective of Boggle is to find assorted words in a small board with assorted tiles. Each tile contains 1 letter. By moving from tile to tile, you can form words. 
You can start a word from any tile on the board, and as long as the next tile in the word is adjacent to that tile, you can continue the word.
You can move forwards, backwords, or diagonally. 

However, you cannot use the same tile twice in a word. You also cannot cross-over the edge of the board. (for example, moving from the top of the board to the bottom) And, obviously, you cannot use the same word twice in one game._
Much like Scrabble, certain words are not aloud in Boggle. Basically any word that starts with a capital letter is not aloud.  Examples would be proper names or countries. Abreviations are not aloud. 
Foreign words are not aloud. Most slang words are not aloud ("gonna", "gotta", "wanna"). Any word with an apostrophe is also not aloud. 
But beyond that, any word, even words with prefixes or suffixes, are aloud. So "Arriving", "Assisted", "Cats", and "Larger" are all valid.

(Hint: The key to success at boggle is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes. Add "S" to every noun you can. Obviously 2 points for "Tiger" is good, but 5 points for "Tiger" and "Tigers" is better. Try to keep an eye for "S", "ER", "ED", and "ING". They all add mega-points!)

Your ultimate objective is to get as many words as possible in a round. When the round is up, you can no longer enter words. You'll have to click: ' shuffle' and try again with a different board!

Scores are simply based on word sizes. A 3 letter word is worth 3 points, a 4 letter word is worth 4 points and so on.

There is a file in the root folder titled "English.text" or "Dutch.text" (depending on which langauge you use). In this file is every single word that the game will recognize as a word in a straight downward 'one-per-line' list. 
There are many words in this file, but obviously, some words might be missing. 
You can add your own words to this file though if you are sure a certain word should be valid.
